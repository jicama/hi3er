Return to Honkai Rentry Index Github Repository Announcement # This ER Guide will no longer be maintained and updated by the main and original person in charge (Adori - Columbina Supremacy#6481) from retirement. **Note: The number behind the Signet Name represents the core** **Eg: Aponia2 = Aponia - Signet of Discipline Core 2 (You Shall Receive Disciplines' Blessing)** The signets are arranged in order of priority Each Difficulty has a noticeable spike and increase in the HP, amidst other things, of the mobs and bosses. This guide does and tests EVERY valk at the maximum Difficulty (Finality, 2.75x) and uses the results of those runs as a reference or measure the strength, potential of a Valkyrie with specific Gears and Ranks. This then also is used as a sort of proof of what the Valkyrie is capable of in the weather in which the video run has been done, or how much clear time you should expect for that valkyrie to do assuming your Valkyrie's Rank, Gears and other impactful buffs (such as Dkey ATK and Dorm Level ATK) are close to or almost equal to the tested run. You can also use the clear times (do prefer to use the ones for the current patch instead of previous patches) as another measurement of how well the Valkyrie does and also use it as a reference for when you're downscaling (when your Valkyrie's Ranks or Gears are lower/weaker than the tested ones). 1D Void = 1.00x 2D Shroud = 1.5x 3D Inferno = 1.75x 4D Submergence = 2x 5D Abstinence = 2.25x 6D Corruption = 2.5x 7D Finality = 2.75x Clearing Abstinence gives ALL the rewards. Corruption additionally gives the FC Emblem that grants 12% TDM and 400 HP when equipped, only applicable to Elysian Realm. This emblem is strongly recommended. Finality gives nothing, we use it for the purpose of testing the Valkyries' strength and as a reference for downscaled difficulty runs if you need it. What do these mean? 1 Yes = At some point get this signet. It doesn't matter when, just that you obtain it, as its a signet needed to make the build work. 1st/2nd/etc = Get this 1st/2nd/etc. Start = Start with this signet. Optional = You can take it at later floors or get them from Felis Shop Signets, as long as you get them in the end. Filler = Only consider going for this if the other portals suck. No = Don't get this. How to signet build? Which F17 Boss to take? When do I visit shop? Click here for more information on how to ER more efficiently. Warnings to look out for current Weather: # Do note the -30% DMG reduction for valkyries of certain weapon types Elysian Realm's 6.2 2nd Half ER Tierlist # By: Adori - Columbina Supremacy#6481 Danger This list has not been updated for the current ER weather. Note Please make sure to read the explanation below regarding the method in which the Tierlist was made before DMing me for whatever reason you might want to, thank you~ There are 2 methods used to determine the Valkyries' placement. Also, from Left to Right = Stronger to Weaker. Their strength in the current weather and how well they do. How well can they downscale (F2P or F2P with some mixed signature gears). A lot of factors can go into the strength of a Valkyrie as well. Please keep that in mind, as not every run will have good signet RNG. Gameplay will not always be perfectly optimized. Divine Key ATK, Dorm Level ATK and Dorm Buffs will also always be varying and thus will affect your Valkyrie's DMG. ATK difference is also another factor. Update log # 2023-01-24: Added PE Knight Form Build. Updated most of the Valkyries' Builds (Signet Priority changed) that have already been covered in my Channel's runs done for this patch. 2023-01-20: Updated HoR, HoFS, HoV, SN Video Runs (6.3).

AKA is yet another one of these valkyries that needs quite the particular investment for comfily using in ER. She wants a minimum rank of S2, and she also wants her pri-arm, without which she struggles quite noticeably. However, there's also something else that adds up into her performance at ER. She's also a highly difficult mechanical valk to optimally play with, as she does have quite a lot of tricks going for her. Most notably, animation cancels, which arguably do provide quite a big and drastic DPS increase for her, both inside and outside ER. Boss to be Chosen: RPC, then Vill-V or Kalpas Setup # Rank Difficulty Done Recommended Gear Clear Time Run SS0 Finality Skadi Pri & 3-set Ana 10:08m (6.1 1st Half) https://youtu.be/8DI2mKbHxNY Danger In downscalability terms, she's downright bad below SS rank. At a minimum of S2 rank however, she isn't as bad, but one problem still remains, she needs her signature Pri. With weaker stigmatas, expect her performance to decrease. Choose difficulty accordingly. Buff Load Taking more than 300 Elemental dmg from the currrent valkyrie makes enemies take 20% more total dmg for 10 seconds. 15 Enemies hit by weapon active take 5% bonus total dmg for 5s 5 For every 60 hits, enemies take 3% more total dmg, capped at 15%. 10 Note Updated for 6.4. Time Remembrance Sigil FC Support Skill Early Veil of Tears The Lonely Moon OR Because of You Mid Gold Goblet / Forbidden Seed / Rainbow of Absence Boundless Logos Late The First Scale Boundless Logos Note With Willows and assuming same rank (SS), it's possible for AKA to instead start with Because of You and get her 2 Ego signets for F7, which will then open the opportunity to get Boundless Logos by F9. Time Support 1 Support 2 Early AE LE Mid AE BK Late AE HB Note Remember to switch out LE for BK at F9/F10 before Heimdall fight. As for LE, you can switch her out once you get yourself a SP regen source like Aponia's. HB on the other hand is better after Heimdall fight, as she will provide highest damage. BR is not recommended due to AKA wanting to stay at more than 70% HP. Elysia - Signet of \u25a0\u25a0 # Signet Priority Blessing of Frost Scythe : Tap [ATK] after evasion to hurl Frost Guisarmier which spins for 5s, gathers enemies nearby, and deal 5400% ATK of Ice DMG. CD: 10s Start Blessing of Stellar Trials : Inflicting Ice Cell also creates a Frost Ring centered around the target lasting 2s which deals 480% ATK of Ice DMG per 0.3s to enemies nearby Start Blessing of Winter Harvest : Enemies recovering from Ice Cell are inflicted with 1 stack of Hypothermia 1st Blessing of Cold Moon : Inflicting Ice Cell also creates a self-centered Frost Ring lasting 6s which deals 180% ATK of Ice DMG per 0.3s to enemies nearby 2nd Blessing of Uranian Mirror : Burst mode consumes 100% more SP and Valkyrie deals 90% bonus Total DMG in burst mode No Note This build mainly relies on 2 Ego signets with 2 other serving as a huge powerspike: Starting with Frost Scythe + Stellar Trails. Frost Scythe will act as your means of reliable gather, being a strong one at that, and also providing pretty decent amounts of damage on a 8s CD. Be mindful of this to spam it every 8 seconds. The other 2 Ego Signets to get are Winter Harvest + Cold Moon. Do NOT get Uranian Mirror. Aponia - Signet of Discipline (1st Core) # Note Ideal course of build up: 2 Ego start into Aponia SP Regen F3, finish Aponia 2nd Core by F4, go shop F5 and swap The Lonely Moon for Because of You, buy Aponia's Penance if possible, otherwise get Mobius' Lip Poison [E] and Hua's Elem Breach. Can upgrade Aponia's Ultimate. Grab Aponia door F6 for Breach and finish Mobius 1st Core by F7 with Entwined [P] and Rodent [V]. Signet Priority Third, No Brutality : Exhortation increases by 5 per second and caps at 200. Valkyrie has bonus SP regen per second equal to 1% of Exhortation. Reaching 160 combo reduces 50% Exhortation. 1st Fifth, No Falsehood : Valkyrie starts with 70 bonus Exhortation. Whenever Exhortation is reduced, enemies take 25% bonus Total DMG for 5s. Can be refreshed. 2nd Fourth, No Insolence : Exhortation increases by 5 per second and caps at 200. Ultimate's Physical and Elemental DMG increases by 0.3% of of Exhortation. Using weapon skills reduces 50% Exhortation. 3rd Nexus Signet 2: You Shall Receive Disciplines' Blessing You Shall Follow Good : You Shall Know Your Sins' Total DMG dealt increases 40% and increases Physical and Elemental Breach by 0.25% of Exhortation for 6s upon hitting an enemy.

How dare they approach her? They must be destroyed by Abyss Flower! Wait... it did really destroy them easily. She's... a monster! Anyway, her damage ceiling is astronomically high. She's a pretty straightforward valkyrie that doesn't have much problems clearing it, however, her requirement for this is to have 3-set Dante and AF is a given. Boss to be Chosen: Husk Mysticism, then Aponia Note Just destroy both with your Stand- oh, I mean, AF! Setup # Rank Difficulty Done Recommended Gear Clear Time Run SS0 Finality Abyss Flower & 3-set Dante 8:29m (6.3) https://youtu.be/h9xdZV3vtZk Danger Truthfully, you shouldn't even bother with this Valkyrie if you don't have BOTH of the shit she needs, which is basically AF and 3-set Dante. AF is a given since Hler Serenity is just bad. As for the 3-set Dante? There's just... no replacement for it. Other than maybe coping with 3-set Dirac. But, again, let's be honest... that's, uh, pretty awkward to cope with. BK really needs the impair right from the get go.

Chrono Navi # Quick Search: Ai, Ai-Chan, CN, Cabbage -- Ignition is so fun! # Note Updated 6.4. Okay, so. Ai-Chan. She's pretty fun, and apparently she makes a really satisfactory sound everytime she deflects her chakrams. Which is kind of interesting for the gameplay itself. She also is comfortable to play due to the good gather that she has, albeit unreliable when the enemies are too far away. But she has some serious problems which will be pointed out below this note. Danger Ai-Chan needs S Rank as a bare minimum to be usable in ER. SS will improve her a bit, however her strength is largely tied to being 4/4. What this means is that she has a horrible downscalability, and you can expect this to be made really clear once this current shilling weather is gone. If your Ai-Chan does not have even a Pri Chakram to use, and your Stigmas aren't her Idol Set, do not expect her to perform very well. Boss to be chosen: Husk Mysticism, then Elysia (to booli her) or Vill-V Setup # Rank Difficulty Done Recommended Gear Clear Time Run SSS Finality Rudder & Idol Set 5:31m (6.2 1st Half) https://youtu.be/SMflvermHCI SS3 Finality Rudder & Idol Set 7:33m (6.2 1st Half) https://youtu.be/Epz2Lsk42o4 S Finality Purana & Leuweenhoek TB Thales M 13:57m (6.2 1st Half) https://youtu.be/HyE8jeEUjkc Note In downscaling terms, she's fucking horrible without her gears. Do expect Ai-Chan's strength to drop considerably without her own Signature set, mainly because of how much damage her ignition does and also because of how much fire-related buffs her set gives that other Fire-related sets don't come close to. Buff Load Taking more than 300 Elemental dmg from the currrent valkyrie makes enemies take 20% more total dmg for 10 seconds. 15 Enemies hit by weapon active take 5% bonus total dmg for 5s 5 For every 60 hits, enemies take 3% more total dmg, capped at 15%. 10 Note Updated for 6.4. Time Remembrance Sigil FC Support Skill Early Veil of Tears The Lonely Moon Mid Light as a Bodhi Leaf / Rainbow of Absence / Pseudo Miracle The Lonely Moon Late Tin Flask or Key to the Deep The Lonely Moon Note Pick your choice here. The Lonely Moon is the best Support Skill you can bring with you. Time Support 1 Support 2 Early AE BR Mid AE BR or BK Late AE BR Note You'll never swap AE out. BR on the other hand can be swapped for BK if needed for Heimdall fight. This is especially recommended due to the usage of Kalpas2 and Ai-Chan lacking good, dependable i-frames alongside being easily interrupted which then makes her really easy to be killed by Heimdall in Red Mode. Without BK, you need good skill through properly evading and making use of her only 2 i-frames in order to get past his Red Mode forcefuly.

Due to the complex mechanics that FR has, she's one of the harder valks to properly play into ER. In fact, much like certain other valks, her performance won't only depend on her gears and ranks, but also will depend on how optimally you can play her. As long as you can consistently and properly do her Evade cancels (especially taking note of Strix-the bird rune- getting off CD to spam him) into Charged ATKs one after another, you can expect things to go well. Her greatest dps is between her ult and the successive Charged ATK chain. Danger This variant sacrifices some early game strength in exchange for enabling FR to dps in ER at below SS2 ranks. Boss to be Chosen: Husk, then Aponia or Kosma Note Aponia is just easier. Kosma is not recommended due to FR lacking enough hitcount potential which would take her too long during the hitcount phases. Setup # Rank Difficulty Done Recommended Gear Clear Time Run SSS Finality Iris Pri & Handel 6:21m (6.1 1st Half) https://youtu.be/xppTS-q5ll4 Danger In downscalability terms, even below SS2 where FR unlocks her \"dps\" potential outside ER, she should be fine here. With lower gears as well. However, do note that FR is a valk that requires her Pri-weapon in order to be used in ER, simply due to the instant Valfreyja Form. Buff Load Taking more than 300 Elemental dmg from the currrent valkyrie makes enemies take 20% more total dmg for 10 seconds. 15 For every 60 hits, enemies take 3% more total dmg, capped at 15%. 10 Time slowed enemies take 8% bonus total dmg for 4s 5 Note Updated for 6.4. Time Remembrance Sigil FC Support Skill Early Veil of Tears Because of You OR The Lonely Moon Mid Memory / Mad King's Mask / Rainbow of Absence The Lonely Moon / Because of You (F5 Shop) Late Tin Flask or Key to the Deep The Lonely Moon Note If your FR is struggling to get through 4F double, you can instead start with The Lonely Moon and delay your 4 Ego powerspike until F11. Time Support 1 Support 2 Early AE BR Mid BK BR Late AE BR Note Remember to swap AE out for BK before Heimdall fight. As for the late floors, you can use BR because by then you'll already have more than enough breach with Aponia's and Hua's combined. For this very same reason. You don't take SN out because of 2nd Load Buff. Signet Priority Blessing of Soul Siphon : In Valfreyja form, Basic ATK siphons extra Disir. It has 2 charges, which reset upon casting God Eater.

Soul Siphon is the signet that will allow FR to chain unlimited Charged ATKs. Valfreyja will be your other main source of big damage. Then, the other 2 Ego signets that become a huge powerspike for FR are Nocturne and God Eater.

What has gotten to you, Roza? How'd you become so strong? So op! Actually, nevermind, she's still a bit... eh. But she sure as hell hits really hard! I still don't like, however, how her personal damage against bosses is kinda ass regardless. Imagine not being able to destroy Hephaestus before he overheats. That's just... lame if you ask me. Come on Roza, you can do better! Boss to be Chosen: Husk Mysticism, then Vill-V Setup # Rank Difficulty Done Recommended Gear Clear Time Run SSS Finality Sleeper's Dream & Michelangelo TB Dante M 7:46m (6.1 1st Half) https://youtu.be/FL43jLuR_Sc Danger For this valkyrie, Sleepri is a given due to the ability to parry Ultimate for Perfect Ultimate aside from the other bonuses that it gives.

Optional 2nd Note Withered Soil is a must to synergize together with Thorns and to skyrocket FT's damage. Silent Night is also good to take, interchangeable with A Flame Extinguished Kalpas - Signet of Decimation (4th Core) # Signet Priority Blade, Grave and Scar : Every 100 HP loss boosts Total DMG by 1.0%. 1st Bone, Blood and Ribbon : Every 100 HP loss boosts Physical & Elemental DMG by 0.8%. 2nd Path, Misfortune and Written Fate : Max HP increases by 25%. 3rd Desireless, Mindless and Homeless : Losing HP boosts Total DMG taken by all enemies by 25% for 8s. 4th Nexus Signet 2: Soldiers, Scissors, Spoils, and Slaughter Optional Note While not necessary to get Kalpas' 2nd Core, you can still take its signets from shop.

Golden Diva # Quick search: Eden, GD -- General Build # Note Updated 6.4. As far as testing goes, this is the current best build for Eden, and other variations with different signets are either weaker, or just don't really work as well as they would seem to do in paper. Take Eden2 for instance, which supposedly GD would be perfectly fine with. Issue? It actually isn't that great. Only acceptable as a versatile option when you don't have any other better alternatives for doors, but otherwise, not recommended to do as early start, as it's garbage. Boss to be Chosen: Husk Mysticism, then Aponia or Vill-V Setup # Rank Difficulty Done Recommended Gear Clear Time Run SSS Finality DoI & Handel 9:03m (6.0 2nd Half) https://youtu.be/iWKlVGS9wnU Danger In terms of downscalability, as long as you have Handel, GD won't be as painful to use, particularly because the atk difference does play in quite a big manner for her damage. It's also due to DoI's buffs difference. Buff Load Taking more than 300 Elemental dmg from the currrent valkyrie makes enemies take 20% more total dmg for 10 seconds. 15 Enemies hit by weapon active take 5% bonus total dmg for 5s 5 For every 60 hits, enemies take 3% more total dmg, capped at 15%. 10 Note Updated for 6.4.

Charge consumed on use and cannot be restored during use. Restores 12 SP after use Optional Blessing of Symphony : Hurl pistols when using Ensemble Playing for 12 SP and dealing 350% Lightning DMG No Note This build requires only 3 Ego signets to function: Arioso + Fugue into Cadenza. You can also additionally take a 4rd Ego door for Concerto, or if you plan on using Eden2, take Symphony, but otherwise NEVER take Symphony, as it heavily relies on minimum 2 SP regen sources (Aponia2 and Eden2). Danger Regarding 2 diff Startup importance: Aponia which includes her Boundless Feeling support skill is weaker for F4 Double, but is a bit stronger start after getting her core. Kosma on the other hand provides easily accessible and comfortable gather, while also being stronger for F4 Double and can very likely guarantee it. This run will assume Aponia start. For Kosma start, you just switch the priority order between the two. (Kosma 1st, Aponia 3rd) Aponia - Signet of Discipline (1st Core) # Note Ideal course of build up: 3 Ego start into Aponia's Basic or Ultimate F3, unlock Aponia 2nd Core by F4, go shop F5, buy 2 of either Kosma or Kalpas signets and reroll for either door accordingly to unlock their core by F6, otherwise Aponia door for enhanced.

Honestly... I'm a bit confused on what to recommend here. But this build worked. It just... worked. Boss to be Chosen: RPC, then Aponia or Kalpas Note You might want to just take Aponia instead of Kalpas unless you want to bald against the Angry Man like I did. Good luck staying alive. Setup # Rank Difficulty Done Recommended Gear Clear Time Run SS0 Finality Naraka & Willows 8:33m (6.3) https://youtu.be/yU1MifKLCVM SS0 Finality 7T & Ana Schariac 10:18m (6.1 1st Half) https://youtu.be/2jg-_BezVv8 Danger In downscalability terms, Memento has some rather weird choices. 7T works on her, but is only stronger against Type-Countered mobs. Muramasa enables a whole new build strategy. For Stigmas, she can use Ana Schariac just fine, followed by Bastet. Buff Load Physical and Elemental dmg increases by 15% for 4s after triggering Ultimate evasion 10 Time slowed enemies take 8% bonus total dmg for 4s 5 Taking more than 300 Elemental dmg from the currrent valkyrie makes enemies take 20% more total dmg for 10 seconds. 15 Note Updated for 6.4. Time Remembrance Sigil FC Support Skill Early Memory Hometown Mid Veil of Tears / Fragile Friend / Rainbow of Absence The Lonely Moon OR Dreamful Gold / Out of Reach Late Tin Flask or Key to the Deep Out of Reach Note Hometown is self-explanatory for +3 Hua signets. If you're struggling though, take The Lonely Moon instead. Afterwards, you can choose to keep it or go with Dreamful Gold (esp for 3* Remembrance Sigil Abuse) or stay with Out of Reach. This latter will become a really reliable source of gather. Time Support 1 Support 2 Early AE BR Mid AE BK Late AE BR Note AE will be your main means of gather aside of her other bonuses. BR will be your bread and butter necessary to get past Early floors with enough damage. You need to bring BK for Heimdall fight, as Memento REALLY struggles without BK's assistance against Heimdall. Elysia - Signet of \u25a0\u25a0 # Signet Priority Blessing of Whiteout : Zankeki deals an extra 100% ATK of Ice DMG in a large area. Each stack of Deep Freeze increases Zankeki's Ice DMG by 1%.

One, it will increase the Load per second to 30, which is good to consider for Memento due to the rate at which she halvens Aponia's Load. Second, it will also increase your Ultimate's DMG. However, do note that this will modify your playstyle if you're using 7T.

Memento didn't had enough fun with 7T and thought it was too simple and easy for her, so she got rid of it and decided to go to a back alley, proceeded to buy a 3 weapon of doubtful quality from a merchant by the name of Senti, got back home and chose the highest difficulty to prove she isn't any weaker and can also do it herself. Was it worth the 500,000,000 yen that the 3 weapon cost her? Did she get scammed by Senti? Or does that not matter? Turns out even the highest difficulty couldn't stop her and she became an unstoppable force of nature! What an absolute madlad! Danger Do note that the best start for this build is Griseo's Red Paint at F2, so it's strongly recommended to mald for it instead of Ego signet. Boss to be Chosen: RPC, then Aponia or Kalpas Note Between Aponia or Kalpas, you can bully either of the two. Pick your preference.

Doing this right will net you 3 FPL's that you can use in total for the floor. For later floors, you can choose to go with TLM or Dreamful Gold based on your preference. Time Support 1 Support 2 Early AE BR Mid AE BK Late AE BR Note AE will be your main means of gather aside of her other bonuses.

Helical Contraption # Quick Search: V-V, Vill-V, Bait, Helical Cripple -- Not Helical Cripple # Note Updated 6.4. All in all, HC is one of the easiest valks to play in ER, and her gameplay doesn't involve anything complicated. The only thing of note to be mindful of is that she greatly values gather as it's better for her to be hitting every mob due to her AoE damage being pretty damn strong. Boss to be Chosen: Husk Mysticism, then Vill-V, Aponia or Kosma Note Pick whichever you want to booli the most!

So far, this is the strongest build. Simple explanation; Starfire is stronger early game, but can fall off a bit later in the game without Reburn and Tempered Warrior, which is also fixed. And then, as a result, you have a stronger general build that's ideally a stronger and perhaps more comfortable start, especially when you have the damage for it. Boss to be Chosen: Husk Mysticism, then Aponia or Vill-V.

Later during the run, you can at some point grab Because of You at shop if you want to make sure you'll get an Ego door for Tempered Warrior, which is strongly recommended to get at all costs. Hua - Signet of Vicissitude (1st Core) # Note Ideal course of build up: 3 Ego Start (Heatflow + Starfire + Reburn) into Hua Elem Breach F3, finish Hua 2nd Core by F4 Double, grab Broken Dream by F5 Shop, use 3 Remembrance Sigil Abuse to get both of Kalpas' DMG boosts or one and one of Sakura's signets and finish Kalpas 2nd Core by F7 Double with 3 Remembrance Sigil Abuse Signet Priority Old Dreams Again : Elemental Breach increases by 0.6% per second 1st Long Trip : Total DMG increases by 1.0% per second. 40 stacks max. Taking DMG reduces 10 stacks 3rd Dark Garb No More : Elemental DMG increases by 0.8% per second 2nd Nexus Signet 2: Suffering Mass Broken Dream : When possessing Soldier's Remembrance., increase the maximum stack of normal Vicissitude signets by 20 Optional Note Getting 2nd Core asap is a really big boost for the remainder of the run for HoFS damage. Kalpas - Signet of Decimation (2nd Core) # Signet Priority Blade, Grave and Scar : Every 100 HP loss boosts Total DMG by 1.0%. 1st Bone, Blood and Ribbon : Every 100 HP loss boosts Physical & Elemental DMG by 0.8%. 2nd Path, Misfortune and Written Fate : Max HP increases by 25%. 3rd Desireless, Mindless and Homeless : Losing HP boosts Total DMG taken by all enemies by 25% for 8s. 4th Nexus Signet 2: Soldiers, Scissors, Spoils, and Slaughter Note It's a MUST to use 3* Remembrance Sigil Abuse to get Kalpas' signets starting at +2 for this current weather at ALL COSTS. This is obvious, as Kalpas is one of HoFS' unchanged main cores and it's also one of her strongest and biggest powerspikes. Kalpas Enhanceds are unnecessary, focus on other Cores and upgrading Kalpas' DMG boosts and TDM Taken instead. Sakura - Signet of Setsuna (3rd Core) # Signet Priority Bountiful Blossom: Koyo : Triggering Ultimate Evasion Skill boosts Total DMG taken by all enemies by 30% for 8s 1st Bountiful Blossom: Botan : Triggering Ultimate Evasion Skill boosts Total DMG by 40% for 8s. 2nd Bountiful Blossom: Fuji : Ultimate Evasion Skill has 1 more charge and 10% reduced CD 3rd Bountiful Blossom: Ayame : Triggering Ultimate Evasion Skill restores 12.0 bonus SP Optional Nexus Signet 1: Setsuna Blade: Sakura-ni-Maku Note It's absolutely essential to ensure you get Sakura1 by the time you reach F11 unless you don't get Tempered Warrior by then, as Sakura 1st Core's synergy with Tempered Warrior is what makes this Core really broken on HoFS. As for the SP on UE signet, it's hugely helpful and beneficial due to allowing you to Ult early into your Herrscher Mode start for the purposes of applying Griseo's Yellow paint and Fallen Leaves later once you have them. Griseo - Signet of Stars (4th Core) # Signet Priority Red & Hot : Using a weapon active taints enemies nearby with red paint for 8s and makes them take 25% bonus Physical and Elemental DMG (cannot stack). Triggering it again resets the duration. 1st Black & Dark : Every time an enemy is tainted, Valkyries deals 10% bonus Physical and Elemental DMG for 20s. 6 stacks max. 2nd Blue & Cold : Triggering an Ultimate Evasion Skill taints enemies nearby with blue paint for 8s and reduces their Total DMG and Move Speed by 30%. Triggering it again resets the duration. 3rd Yellow & Warm : Using an Ultimate taints enemies nearby with yellow paint for 8s and makes them take 30% bonus Total DMG. Triggering it again resets the duration. 4th Grey & Empty : Enemies stay tainted for 5s longer. Optional 5th Nexus Signet 2: Faded Stars Petals in the Wind : When red and blue taint triggers Blending, enemies within 8m are dealt 1200%/500% ATK of Adaptive DMG; CD: 3s. Also taints yourself purple for 15s, increasing the effect of red, yellow, and blue taint by 40%. Triggering it again resets the duration. 1st Fallen Leaves : When yellow and blue taint triggers Blending along with an AoE ATK dealing 800% ATK of Adaptive DMG; CD: 3s. Also taints yourself green for 15s, increasing Total DMG 20% for each taint in Faded Stars. Triggering it again resets the duration. 2nd A Flame Extinguished : When red and yellow taint triggers Blending you become tainted orange for 15s, triggering Time Fracture for 2.5s and reducing enemy Physical Defense 40% and Elemental Resist 15% for 10s; CD: 7s. Triggering it again resets the duration. Optional 3rd Note Red & Hot is the absolute highest priority to +3. Yellow can also be upgraded to +3 provided you have Sakura's SP on UE signet. One important thing to note here: You'll want to make sure to get Yellow next if you happen to get Fallen Leaves from a Griseo door. Or in the case you get A Flame Extinguished, then pick Yellow over it. Pardofelis - Signet of Reverie (5th Core) # Signet Priority Neighborhood Chatters : Every 100 Shiny Silvers obtained this round boost max HP by 25 and max SP by 1. 1st Motto of Meow : Every 100 Shiny Silvers obtained this round boost Total DMG by 1%. 2nd Back-Curled Tail : Every 100 Shiny Silvers obtained this round boost Physical and Elemental DMG by 0.8%. 3rd Nexus Signet 1: Empty Dreams, Self, Set, and Joy : Nexus Signet 2: Empty Illusions, Empty Fantasies : Note Your highest priority should be getting the Max HP/SP signet, instead of getting Pardo's core. -- (Meme Build) Burger King Tuna # Note Updated 6.1. The strength of this build noticeably goes up in Kalpas +2 weathers. Boss to be Chosen: Husk Mysticism, then Elysia, Aponia (easiest) or Vill-V. Setup # Rank Difficulty Done Recommended Gear Clear Time Run S0 Finality DoI & 3-set Himeko 5:26m (6.0 1st Half) https://youtu.be/YRwcFNoFUWk S0 Finality DoI & Shelley T Himeko M Scott B 10:36m (6.0 2nd Half) https://youtu.be/l5wUpammzF0 Note This build is downscaleable with lower clear times and lower gear requirement. However, you preferentially want Himeko M to be present for this build, as it makes it stronger. Buff Load Physical and Elemental dmg increases by 15% for 4s after triggering Ultimate evasion 10 Time slowed enemies take 8% bonus total dmg for 4s 5 Taking more than 300 Elemental dmg from the currrent valkyrie makes enemies take 20% more total dmg for 10 seconds. 15 Note Updated for 6.4. Time Remembrance Sigil FC Support Skill Early Mad King's Mask The Lonely Moon Mid Memory / Rainbow of Absence / Forget-Me-Not An Old Pal's Legacy Late Key to the Deep An Old Pal's Legacy Note This build prefers to go Felis shop early in F5 so you can swap The Lonely Moon for An Old Pal's Legacy right away before further continuing. Time Support 1 Support 2 Early AE BR Mid VK BR Late AE BR Note You want to save BR specifically for after entering Herrscher Mode on the first snap. Basically, when you're about to use your first Blackhole in Herrscher Form for the maximum output of damage possible. Combine this with Sirin and Kalpas Support Skill and you end up dealing a shitton of damage. Danger VK for Heimdall fight is recommended in order to fill his Heavy Bar Trauma. Do note that this is specifically for getting him out of Red Mode forcibly once its filled. Elysia - Signet of \u25a0\u25a0 # Signet Priority Blessing of Heatflow : Black holes generated by the Herrscher of Flamescion deal 75% bonus Fire DMG. Triggering Ultimate Evasion Skill creates an additional black hole Start Blessing of Starfire When a black hole created by the Herrscher of Flamescion ends, a smaller black hole lasting 5s is generated to deal 300% ATK of Fire DMG per second. CD: 3s Start Blessing of Reburn Triggering Ultimate Evasion Skill removes Overheat and clears Heat 1st Blessing of Tempered Warrior Aerial Combo ATKs reduce Ultimate Evasion Skill CD by 9s 2nd Blessing of Flamescion For every black hole created by the Herrscher of Flamescion, Valkyrie restores 25 HP per second and deals 30% bonus Total DMG No Note The minimum requirement of Tuna is to have Heatflow and Reburn as her starting signets. Without Reburn, she feels awful to play. Without Heatflow, she doesn't feel like she has much damage. So, a double Ego start is essential for Tuna. Afterwards, getting a 3rd Ego door is very good, taking Tempered Warrior to make the entire run easier and feel better. 4th is also taken for Starfire, adding even more damage but it's not really necessary. Kalpas - Signet of Decimation (1st Core) # Note Ideal course of build up: 3 Ego Start (Heatflow + Starfire + Reburn) into Kalpas' TDM by F3, Kalpas 2nd Core by F4 w/Max HP, F5 Shop for switching The Lonely Moon for An Old Pal's Legacy and grab Sakura's Fuji or Hua's Elem Breach, get Sakura or Hua door F6, finish Hua 2nd Core by F7. Signet Priority Blade, Grave and Scar : Every 100 HP loss boosts Total DMG by 1.0%. 1st Bone, Blood and Ribbon : Every 100 HP loss boosts Physical & Elemental DMG by 0.8%. 2nd Path, Misfortune and Written Fate : Max HP increases by 25%. 3rd Desireless, Mindless and Homeless : Losing HP boosts Total DMG taken by all enemies by 25% for 8s. Optional Nexus Signet 2: Soldiers, Scissors, Spoils, and Slaughter Hometown, Homeland, Friends, and Acquaintances : The cap of Bloodboil Armor charges increases by 500. At over 1500 charges, Bloodboil Armor grants 25% Physical and Elemental Breach. Optional (Priority only by F9 afterwards) Body, Bones, Heart, and Soul : The Bloodboil Armor charges cap increases by 500. When its charges exceed 1500, if it gains HP recovery, when it next deals DMG to enemies, it will have a bonus 800% ATK of adaptive DMG. CD: 5s. Optional (Not necessary) Danger You leave Kalpas enhanceds for later on. 2 reasons. Getting a Sakura signet or being able to finish Hua 2nd Core by F7 double or even getting Tempered Warrior is higher value. And trying to get one after finishing his 2nd core is a massive slowdown on the pace, as it feels like it's not really doing anything to help u. This is the reason getting other signets instead is better. So, leave this for after you get 2nd core. Note I also strongly recommend upgrading Kalpas' Max HP after both of his DMG boosts if you're using Himeko. Himeko M giving 25% max HP paired with Kalpas 40% Max HP from +3 and Pardofelis Max HP signet makes it possible to reach up to 16k or 17k HP which gives Kalpas an absolutely massive scaling on his +3 DMG Boosts. When using Shelley T Himeko M Scott B variation, it's even more of a priority as it reaches up to 22.5k HP. Hua - Signet of Vicissitude (2nd Core) # Signet Priority Old Dreams Again : Elemental Breach increases by 0.6% per second 1st Dark Garb No More : Elemental DMG increases by 0.8% per second 2nd Long Trip : Total DMG increases by 1.0% per second. 40 stacks max. Taking DMG reduces 10 stacks 3rd Nexus Signet 2: Suffering Mass Broken Dream : When possessing Soldier's Remembrance., increase the maximum stack of normal Vicissitude signets by 20 Optional Note The breach right away is a really big boost in HoFS damage for the remainder of the run. Sakura - Signet of Setsuna (3rd or 4th Core) # Signet Priority Bountiful Blossom: Fuji : Ultimate Evasion Skill has 1 more charge and 10% reduced CD 1st Bountiful Blossom: Koyo : Triggering Ultimate Evasion Skill boosts Total DMG taken by all enemies by 30% for 8s Optional Bountiful Blossom: Botan : Triggering Ultimate Evasion Skill boosts Total DMG by 40% for 8s. Optional Bountiful Blossom: Ayame : Triggering Ultimate Evasion Skill restores 12.0 bonus SP Optional Nexus Signet 1: Setsuna Blade: Sakura-ni-Maku Note Fuji, Koyo and Botan are preferred to pick up from Felis Shop, with Fuji being the absolute first priority, especially when missing Tempered Warrior. Read the danger for further explanation. Danger Sakura's Core is not necessary to complete. After getting Fuji, you can proceed to focus on getting Griseo and finishing Sakura 1st core on later floors, particularly after Mech Land. Also, Ayame is good to consider taking for the purposes of getting Yellow applied through early Ultimate so you can get your maximum damage output as soon as possible, however you can also instead pick Eden's Initial/Max SP for this. Griseo - Signet of Stars (4th or 3rd Core) # Signet Priority Red & Hot : Using a weapon active taints enemies nearby with red paint for 8s and makes them take 25% bonus Physical and Elemental DMG (cannot stack). Triggering it again resets the duration. 1st Black & Dark : Every time an enemy is tainted, Valkyries deals 10% bonus Physical and Elemental DMG for 20s. 6 stacks max. 2nd Blue & Cold : Triggering an Ultimate Evasion Skill taints enemies nearby with blue paint for 8s and reduces their Total DMG and Move Speed by 30%. Triggering it again resets the duration. 3rd Yellow & Warm : Using an Ultimate taints enemies nearby with yellow paint for 8s and makes them take 30% bonus Total DMG. Triggering it again resets the duration. 4th Nexus Signet 2: Faded Stars Petals in the Wind : When red and blue taint triggers Blending, enemies within 8m are dealt 1200%/500% ATK of Adaptive DMG; CD: 3s. Also taints yourself purple for 15s, increasing the effect of red, yellow, and blue taint by 40%. Triggering it again resets the duration. 1st Fallen Leaves : When yellow and blue taint triggers Blending along with an AoE ATK dealing 800% ATK of Adaptive DMG; CD: 3s. Also taints yourself green for 15s, increasing Total DMG 20% for each taint in Faded Stars. Triggering it again resets the duration. 2nd A Flame Extinguished : When red and yellow taint triggers Blending you become tainted orange for 15s, triggering Time Fracture for 2.5s and reducing enemy Physical Defense 40% and Elemental Resist 15% for 10s; CD: 7s. Triggering it again resets the duration. 3rd Note Due to HoFS' problem of using Ult right away to apply Yellow, you'll usually want to leave at least one charge of UE for the purposes of being able to reset Overheat meter right after using Ultimate. Also one important thing to note here: You'll want to make sure to get Yellow next if you happen to get Fallen Leaves from a Griseo door. Or in the case you get A Flame Extinguished, then pick Yellow over it. Pardofelis - Signet of Reverie (5th Core) # Signet Priority Neighborhood Chatters : Every 100 Shiny Silvers obtained this round boost max HP by 25 and max SP by 1. 1st Motto of Meow : Every 100 Shiny Silvers obtained this round boost Total DMG by 1%. 2nd Back-Curled Tail : Every 100 Shiny Silvers obtained this round boost Physical and Elemental DMG by 0.8%. 3rd Nexus Signet 1: Empty Dreams, Self, Set, and Joy : Note Max HP/SP is what we're mainly looking for. Eden - Signet of Gold (6th Core) # Signet Priority Recitatif of Fine Jade : Initial SP and max SP increase by 30. 1st Note This is strongly recommended to take as soon as you can, due to it enabling HoFS to instantly ult before starting her herrscher mode, thus being able to apply Yellow paint, and along with it, Fallen Leaves right away for the biggest damage bonuses possible right off the bat. Herrscher of Humanity # Quick Search: Elysia, HoH, HoHe, Manta Ray, H2O, Water -- Ultimate Build # Note Updated for 6.4. The strongest variation with the only downside of having to go through Elysia's long animation times everytime. Also heavily favored currently by Load Buffs. HoH still remains and stays strong on her position as ER's Cheatcode queen than to assert her dominance through her Ultimate Build? Boss to be Chosen: RPC, then Elysia for fastest time, Mobius, Kalpas or Vill-V. Note Literally pick whoever you want to booli the most~ Setup # Rank Difficulty Done Recommended Gear Clear Time Run S1 Finality DoEgo & 3-set Pristine 3:25m (6.2 1st Half) https://youtu.be/so6lrGU2Pfw S0 Finality DoEgo & Ana Schariac 7:29m (6.2 1st Half) https://youtu.be/hPpEOO-q2MA S2 Finality CoC & Scott TM Rasputin B 7:59m (6.1 2nd Half) https://youtu.be/lNvGfE_4Czs Note HoH's downscalability is amazing, as she can still perform well even on poverty gears like CoC and Scott TM Rasp B. However, for this current weather, it's recommended to put something better due to the slight nerf to HoH's strength. Buff Load Taking more than 300 Elemental dmg from the currrent valkyrie makes enemies take 20% more total dmg for 10 seconds. 15 Enemies hit by weapon active take 5% bonus total dmg for 5s 5 Physical and Elemental dmg increases by 15% for 4s after triggering Ultimate evasion 10 Note Updated for 6.4. Time Remembrance Sigil FC Support Skill Early Rainbow of Absence The Lonely Moon Mid Pseudo Miracle / Rainbow of Absence / Memory / Forget-Me-Not The Lonely Moon Late Tin Flask or Key to the Deep The Lonely Moon Note TLM will give you a massive help in getting the F4 Double bonus cleared and will also provide an instant +2 to any Griseo signets you encounter in shop, or if you use the 3* Remembrance Sigil Abuse, it's possible to grab them at +3 right away which is really important to do! Time Support 1 Support 2 Early AE BR Mid AE/BK BR Late HB BR Note HoE honestly doesn't need anyone else. BR is necessary in order to do the early low HP abuse strat by spending 5+ minutes on a floor after clearing it and waiting on BR to use her off CD, repeating until you're below 200 HP. BR also has the added benefit of simply granting you way better chances at clearing through the early floors and even the remainder of the run as easily as possible. AE can be replaced for HB once you have too much excess Breach. Elysia - Signet of \u25a0\u25a0 # Signet Priority Blessing of First Bloom : In Herrscher of Origin Form, Ice DMG increases by 50%. In Herrscher of Human Form, using Charged ATKs reduces Ultimate CD by 1s and restores 20 SP. Start Blessing of First Journey : When switching to Herrscher Form, increase DMG taken by all enemies by 40% for 5s and gain 4 Pristine Crystals. Charged ATKs in Herrscher of Human Form and Ultimate Evasion Skill in Herrscher of Origin Form will clear all Pristine Crystals to deal 1200% x 4 ATK of Ice DMG. Start Blessing of First Awakening : In Herrscher of Origin Form, triggering Ultimate Evasion Skill restores 400 Herrscher Charge and Charged ATKs and special weapon skill deal an additional 1500% ATK of Ice DMG. 1st Blessing of First Encounter : Charged ATKs in Herrscher of Human Form pull enemies on both sides of the arrow slightly towards the center. Charged ATKs deal an additional 1200% ATK of Ice DMG. If a Charged ATK hits more than 10 times, enemies take 10% more Total DMG from Charged ATKs for every Nexus Signet owned (cannot stack). No Blessing of First Yearning : In Herrscher of Human Form, Charged ATK Speed increases by 30% for 5s after triggering Ultimate Evasion Skill. When using Charged ATK, shooting speed continously increases, up to a maximum of 80%. Move Speed while using Charged ATKs increases by 100%. Resets when Charged ATK ends. When Charged ATK hits, Ultimate Evasion CD decreases by 2.5s and weapon skill CD decreases by 1s. Gain 1 stack of Crystal Ice Mirror for every Charged ATK that hits an enemy. Every stack of Crystal Ice Mirror increases DMG from Charged ATK's by 10%. No Note This build is best taken with 3 Ego signets, basically, double reroll is its most ideal start. Bloom + Journey is the startup while Awakening is the 3rd Ego signet taken by F2. Journey is simply 10x times better and far stronger, and the way you use it is save the Crystals (used on Evade mainly) to oneshot a wave, then use Active + Charged for 2nd Wave. Use Finisher early after that and get your 2nd Ult ASAP for another round of Crystals from Journey. Griseo - Signet of Stars (1st Core) # Note Ideal Order from F1-F7: Double Ego Start (Bloom + Journey) into Awakening at F2, get Griseo's Red at F3, finish Griseo 2nd Core by F4 Double with Yellow and Black, then grab Griseo's Petals in the Wind or Fallen leaves F5, go shop F6 and buy Griseo's Blue Paint, use 3* Remembrance Sigil Abuse to try and get Kalpas' both TDM and Elem DMG boosts at +3 followed by either Sakura TDM or TDM Taken, or one of Hua or Vill-V's signets. Then grab Griseo door for F7 Double to get the remaining 2 Enhanceds. Signet Priority Red & Hot : Using a weapon active taints enemies nearby with red paint for 8s and makes them take 25% bonus Physical and Elemental DMG (cannot stack). Triggering it again resets the duration. 1st Yellow & Warm : Using an Ultimate taints enemies nearby with yellow paint for 8s and makes them take 30% bonus Total DMG. Triggering it again resets the duration. 2nd Black & Dark : Every time an enemy is tainted, Valkyries deals 10% bonus Physical and Elemental DMG for 20s. 6 stacks max. 3rd Blue & Cold : Triggering an Ultimate Evasion Skill taints enemies nearby with blue paint for 8s and reduces their Total DMG and Move Speed by 30%. Triggering it again resets the duration. 4th Nexus Signet 2: Faded Stars Petals in the Wind : When red and blue taint triggers Blending, enemies within 8m are dealt 1200%/500% ATK of Adaptive DMG; CD: 3s. Also taints yourself purple for 15s, increasing the effect of red, yellow, and blue taint by 40%.

Triggering it again resets the duration. Filler Note Red is the absolute highest priority to +3. Yellow +3 is also good, you can keep refreshing it through ending Ult early, if you don't want to, you can take Grey. You can also go for the 3* Remembrance Sigil abuse in order to maximize your gains with Griseo and get +3 on all of her signets, making it maximum stonks. A Flame Extinguished is not necessary due to excess breach, but can be taken for stronger Fallen Leaves and more damage. Kalpas - Signet of Decimation (2nd Core) # Signet Priority Blade, Grave and Scar : Every 100 HP loss boosts Total DMG by 1.0%. 1st Bone, Blood and Ribbon : Every 100 HP loss boosts Physical & Elemental DMG by 0.8%. 2nd Path, Misfortune and Written Fate : Max HP increases by 25%. 3rd Desireless, Mindless and Homeless : Losing HP boosts Total DMG taken by all enemies by 25% for 8s. 4th Nexus Signet 2: Soldiers, Scissors, Spoils, and Slaughter Optional Note HoE doesn't really need to finish Kalpas core but in this run we take it anyways. Hua - Signet of Vicissitude (3rd Core) # Signet Priority Long Trip : Total DMG increases by 1.0% per second. 40 stacks max. Taking DMG reduces 10 stacks. 1st Dark Garb No More : Elemental DMG increases by 0.8% per second. 40 stacks max. Taking DMG reduces 10 stacks. 2nd Old Dreams Again : Elemental Breach increases by 0.6% per second. 40 stacks max.

Losing all Soldier's Remembrance stacks reduces the max stacks by 10 but restores 1 Soldier's Remembrance stack. Can only be triggered once every battle. Optional Note Broken Dream is a good gamble to try and take. Hua is interchangeable with Pardo as you can instead opt to take Pardo's instead of Hua. Vill-V - Signet of Helix (4th Core) # Signet Priority Act V: Spider Web : Using a weapon active boosts Valkyrie ranged Total DMG by 40% for 4.5s.

During Global Time Fracture caused by detonation, enemies take 30% more Total DMG in addition. 1st Puppetry: Interlacing Cells : Extends Global Time Fracture caused by Specail Weapon: No. 4's detonation by 3s. During Global Time Fracture, gain 30% Physical and Elemental Breach. 2nd Note Although Puppetry will give excess breach, it's still recommended due to extending the Time Fracture to abuse Drama's additional TDT. Thus, in this case, Drama is the highest priority to +3 and Puppetry is ignored. Sakura - Signet of Setsuna (5th Core) # Signet Priority Bountiful Blossom: Botan : Triggering Ultimate Evasion Skill boosts Total DMG by 40% for 8s. 1st Bountiful Blossom: Koyo : Triggering Ultimate Evasion Skill boosts Total DMG taken by all enemies by 30% for 8s. 2nd Bountiful Blossom: Ayame : Triggering Ultimate Evasion Skill restores 12.0 bonus SP. 3rd Nexus Signet 1: Setsuna Blade: Sakura ni Maku Optional Nexus Signet 2: Setsuna Blade: Shinra Bansho Optional Note It is not necessary to finish Sakura's Cores, but if you do, the choice between both Cores doesn't matter. 2nd Core can provide a bit of DMG.

Pristine B can also be replaced by Adler B or Rita: Spina Astera B, or any other good B stigma you have as long as it's good enough. Buff Load Taking more than 300 Elemental dmg from the currrent valkyrie makes enemies take 20% more total dmg for 10 seconds. 15 Enemies hit by weapon active take 5% bonus total dmg for 5s 5 Physical and Elemental dmg increases by 15% for 4s after triggering Ultimate evasion 10 Note Updated for 6.4.

The slightly weaker variant with slightly less clear time, but nevertheless at the same strength as Ult build. Boss to be Chosen: RPC, then Elysia for fastest time, Mobius, Kalpas or Vill-V. Note Literally pick whoever you want to booli the most~ Setup # Rank Difficulty Done Recommended Gear Clear Time Run S1 Finality DoEgo & 3-set Pristine 4:24m (6.2 1st Half) https://youtu.be/rTrXdCLpKl4 S2 Finality CoC & Scott TM Rasp B 7:39m (6.1 2nd Half) https://youtu.be/CxXYamDEaMw Danger Please do note that normally, Vill-V would also be included in Ballista build. However, specifically for the F2P Run using CoC & Scott TM Rasp B, I haven't used Vill-V at all, with the reason being playing around charging V-V support skill being a bit hard to play around properly alongside its buffs and the fact that if it's not DoEgo, HoE doesn't have 3 Actives instead of 2. In better geared runs, this build will use Vill-V. Note HoH's downscalability is amazing, as she can still perform well even on poverty gears like CoC and Scott TM Rasp B. However, for this current weather, it's recommended to put something better due to the slight nerf to HoH's strength. Buff Load Taking more than 300 Elemental dmg from the currrent valkyrie makes enemies take 20% more total dmg for 10 seconds. 15 Enemies hit by weapon active take 5% bonus total dmg for 5s 5 Physical and Elemental dmg increases by 15% for 4s after triggering Ultimate evasion 10 Note Updated for 6.4.

It's strongly recommended. Time Support 1 Support 2 Early AE BR Mid AE BR Late AE or HB BR Note HoE honestly doesn't need anyone else. BR is necessary in order to do the early low HP abuse strat by spending 5+ minutes on a floor after clearing it and waiting on BR to use her off CD, repeating until you're below 200 HP. BR also has the added benefit of simply granting you way better chances at clearing through the early floors and even the remainder of the run as easily as possible. AE can be replaced for HB once you have too much excess Breach. Elysia - Signet of \u25a0\u25a0 # Signet Priority Blessing of First Yearning : In Herrscher of Human Form, Charged ATK Speed increases by 30% for 5s after triggering Ultimate Evasion Skill.

No Note Ballista build only requires 2 Ego signets (Encounter + Yearning), allowing the opportunity for HoE to do Griseo Red Paint start instead which is strongly recommended. Aponia - Signet of Discipline (1st Core) # Note Ideal Order from F1-F7: Reroll start for Griseo Red Paint at F2 into Aponia Basic ATK F3, finish Aponia 2nd Core by F4 Double, grab Aponia's Breach F5, go shop F6 and buy Kalpas' both DMG boosts, then you can either grab Aponia Door F7 Double or take Kalpas Door if you were able to only get 1 of his signets.

If you're curious about the reason why this build is one of the less popular builds, it's simply because of the high investment that it demands in terms of Ego signets required. To begin with, while it requires the Ego (Clone) signet in order to start being used, it meant that Dark Plumes had to be left out. No SP Regen and free 30% TDM Taken was just bad. That was the weakness of this build; it just was hard to sustain and took too long to come online into the game. Boss to be Chosen: Husk Mysticism, then Elysia, Vill-V or Aponia Note Mysticism is a rather tough nut to crack. HoS needs heavy investment into Griseo2 aside from having her other 3 main Cores already finished. What this means is that you might be lacking on the necessary damage to finish Mysticism off before he goes into his ~~bullshit~~ balls phase. Do make sure to save your supports for that phase, if you can. Setup # Rank Difficulty Done Recommended Gear Clear Time Run S0 Finality Senpri & Shattered Swords 6:25m (6.3) https://youtu.be/OorRWyMp2-o Note In downscalability terms, HoS' strength can have sharp decreases especially when the Stigmas don't give Crit Rate, but SirinA, Elysia and Dirac TM are good alternatives. Buff Load For every 60 hits, enemies take 3% more total dmg, capped at 15%. 10 Physical and Elemental dmg increases by 15% for 4s after triggering Ultimate evasion 10 Time slowed enemies take 8% bonus total dmg for 4s 5 Note Updated for 6.4. Time Remembrance Sigil FC Support Skill Early Forbidden Seed Boundless Logos Mid Veil of Tears / Golden Goblet / Rainbow of Absence / Mad King's Mask Boundless Logos Late Good Old Days or Tin Flask or Key to the Deep Boundless Logos Note Boundless Logos will be your staple Support Skill for the remainder of the run, it will never be swapped out other than for 3* Remembrance Sigil Abuse if it's uncharged. Time Support 1 Support 2 Early SA / SS BR Mid BK BR or BKE Late SS BR Note Two things to note here. SA can be your staple first support for the entire run, or you can swap her for SS later by F6 and above. SS is just stronger due to the 35% Phys Taken, but otherwise her buff is only for 1 wave, which means she loses against SA in terms of mobbing floors, but destroys her on Bossing floors. Second, you really want to bring BK into Heimdall, as HoS struggles against him. Elysia - Signet of \u25a0\u25a0 # Signet Priority Blessing of Victory : In Herrscher Form, Combo ATK: Slashes can have up to 18 slashes.

Triggering it again resets the duration. 3rd Note Red is highest priority to +3. Yellow is good to +3 when you have Grey. Be mindful of adjusting your gameplay around Griseo's paints: this doesn't matter in mobbing floors, but for Bossing floors, you want to save your Active into halfway your 1st Combo (you wanna get your SP for ulting ASAP) and your UE Clone for proccing Blue paint. Basically, you ideally want to have all 3 paints applied in roughly the same window so that they last for an entire Burst duration. Kalpas - Signet of Decimation (5th Core) # Signet Priority Blade, Grave and Scar : Every 100 HP loss boosts Total DMG by 1.0%. 1st Bone, Blood and Ribbon : Every 100 HP loss boosts Physical & Elemental DMG by 0.8%. 2nd Path, Misfortune and Written Fate : Max HP increases by 25%. 3rd Desireless, Mindless and Homeless : Losing HP boosts Total DMG taken by all enemies by 25% for 8s.

HoS already suffers from an horribly low Crit Rate, and you can expect a warm welcome from... an ocean of blue numbers... if not using either Sswords or SirinA (Sswords 10x times better) Buff Load For every 60 hits, enemies take 3% more total dmg, capped at 15%. 10 Physical and Elemental dmg increases by 15% for 4s after triggering Ultimate evasion 10 Time slowed enemies take 8% bonus total dmg for 4s 5 Note Updated for 6.4.

No Note The normal, standard starter signets for HoS are Victory into Dark Plumes. This specific run uses Legion, which doesn't really have any difference. Just go Dark Plumes instead, it will give better results. Supremacy is also strongly recommended to take. Aponia - Signet of Discipline (1st Core) # Note Ideal Order from F1-F7: Double Ego Start (Victory + Dark Plumes) into Aponia Ultimate (SP Regen if Legion) F3, finish Aponia 2nd Core by F4, grab Aponia's Penance (TDM Taken first if Legion) at F5, go shop F6 and grab Kosma's Ultimate, Shieldbreak and Ultimate Evasion in order, can also grab Griseo's Red and Yellow but as long as you have Shieldbreak and means of applying Rend you'll be good to go.

Triggering it again resets the duration. Filler Note Ultimate is high priority to +3. The reason you don't take Breach here is because of the 75% existing Impair that HoS already provides in her Ultimate. You'll basically be losing some value out of it. Kosma - Signet of Daybreak (2nd Core) # Signet Priority Horns that Rip the Bleak Sky : Ultimate inflicts 15 stacks of Rend on all enemies, each stack dealing 25% ATK of Adaptive DMG per second for 10s. 70 stacks max.

Also taints yourself green for 15s, increasing Total DMG 20% for each taint in Faded Stars. Triggering it again resets the duration. 2nd Note The moment you get any of the basic paints from Griseo, the gameplay changes. It's essential to save the wep active and UE skill to time them together with her Ultimate. Taint Extension is also very crucial for this, as the ++2 alone will increase the duration from 8s to 15s, making up for an entire ult duration of 2 complete series of Victory Slashes. Pardofelis - Signet of Reverie (Felis Shop Signets) # Signet Priority Neighborhood Chatters : Every 100 Shiny Silvers obtained this round boost max HP by 25 and max SP by 1. 1st Herrscher of Thunder # Quick search: HoT, Mei, hot mei, dragon -- 4-5 Revived Build # Note Updated 6.4. This is the 3rd strongest build, and also competes with the others in being the most braindead to play... sort of. The strength of this build is that it is very solid and has damage on everything. 4-5, 7T actives, Dragon slam, Finisher, Shinzan. Overall, it's pretty good. Danger Do note though, that this build is not recommended if your HoT is not S1+. Narukami Finisher is stronger. Boss to be chosen: Husk Mysticism, then Elysia or Mobius/Vill-V Setup # Rank Difficulty Done Recommended Gear Clear Time Run SS1 Finality 65 7T & Handel 6:53m (6.0 1st Half) https://youtu.be/hRm5kgih2ao Note This build's downscalability in terms of weapon and stigmatas has yet to be tested. I cannot say yet how it will do without 7T and Handel, especially 7T as it's what makes this build work, and Handel offers a massive damage boost compared to Benares Awakening or other cope stigmatas. However, if you do have them, even if underleveled, then you can downscale accordingly. Buff Load Taking more than 300 Elemental dmg from the currrent valkyrie makes enemies take 20% more total dmg for 10 seconds. 15 Time slowed enemies take 8% bonus total dmg for 4s 5 For every 60 hits, enemies take 3% more total dmg, capped at 15%. 10 Note Updated for 6.4.

These 2 form the core of the build. A 3rd Ego door for Narukami is strongly recommended, as it further enhances this build and makes it even stronger.

Boss to be Chosen: Husk Mysticism, then Elysia, Aponia or Vill-V Note Hephaestus is only ever taken if you want the fastest clear time for F17. If you aren't looking for that, then by any means, just stick with Husk instead, as it's the safer and more comfortable option.

Virtuality helps to offset this to some extent however, if you don't manage to get Hua's 2nd core in the run. Note Do the Remembrance Sigil Abuse preferably, look out getting Hua's Phys/Elem DMG and Phys Breach to +3.

Pardo2 preferred if you don't, or you don't care about it. Infinite Ouroboros # Quick Search: IO, Snake, Snek, Mobius -- General # Note Updated for 6.4. Honestly, this is a really fun and genuine surprise that I wasn't expecting to hit this strong. Who would've thought that non-Linnaeus Mobius would be so damn strong nonetheless? Clearly, she doesn't need it, and neither does she gives a fuck about having DMG Reduction trying to weigh her down. Boss to be Chosen: RPC, then Vill-V or Aponia Note The choice between Andrius or Husk is difficult. Andrius has a really thick shield for non-fire Valkyries, making the fight harder even for Mobius. Husk on the other hand can be easier despite the type-counter. Vill-V is the best choice easily if you have Miniature [X] available.

Time Remembrance Sigil FC Support Skill Early Forbidden Seed Boundless Logos Mid Veil of Tears / Rainbow of Absence / Mad King's Mask Boundless Logos Late The First Scale or Tin Flask Boundless Logos Note Boundless Logos is a given. It is not swapped out due to the brutal efficiency in which Mobius can abuse it. However, when it's low on charge by the time you go into Shop, then you can consider swapping it out in order to abuse the 3* Remembrance Sigil gamble. Time Support 1 Support 2 Early AE BR or LE Mid BK BR or LE Late AE BR or LE Note Due to the existing Load Buff granting 10 SP per 60 SP restored, Mobius can make really good use out of BR right away from the start. Once this is gone, however, LE is used instead unless you're otherwise missing damage in which case BR is the best choice to go here. Remember to bring BK for Heimdall fight.

Optional 2nd Note Dead [X]'s impact is mainly from being a ramping up buff, so it's not so much of a problem to not get it early on, meanwhile Unknown [X] is a good choice to take in case you don't manage to get Dead [X]. Also, Dead [X] is really high priority to upgrade to +3. Aponia - Signet of Discipline (2nd Core) # Signet Priority First, No Betrayal : Exhortation increases by 5 per second and caps at 200.

Midnight Absinthe # Quick search: MA, Raven, Natasha Cioara -- Who needs IMG Weather? # Note Updated 6.4. Honestly, considering only base A ranks and non-Flame Chasers, Raven is probably one of the strongest valkyries to clear ER. At least, in weathers that are not so unfavorable for her. She's rather excellent, albeit a bit awkward and her gameplay pretty much just revolves around controlling the appropiate timings. Boss to be Chosen: Andrius, then Vill-V Setup # Rank Difficulty Done Recommended Gear Clear Time Run SSS Finality DoEgo & Aslaug 12:08m (6.1) https://youtu.be/rkCnkA44e4s Danger There's no other set that will work better than Aslaug does for her, especially since Aslaug enormously increases her Mist's already skyhigh damage.

Anyone that's on her screen at the moment of using her Charged ATK will be gathered in front of her Severance. It also has a big AoE that hits every one of these mobs. And since the 1800% DMG explosion from it has a delay, it means that if the wave was killed by the downward attack, then the next wave will be damaged by Severance and be impaired already, giving it a edge on potential DPS. Boss to be chosen: Husk Mysticism, then Aponia or Vill-V.

Hua - Signet of Vicissitude (1st Core) # Note Ideal Order from F1-F7: 3 Ego Start (Exodus + Abyssal Chant + Commitment) into Hua's TDM or Phys Breach F3, finish Hua 2nd Core by F4 Double, grab Broken Dream F5 and go shop F6, use 3* Remembrance Sigil Abuse to buy Griseo's Red Paint and Aponia's First OR Vill-V's Pendulum/Conflict.

In Penance, the Valkyrie takes 30% less Total DMG and deals 40% more Physical and Elemental DMG to enemies. Valkyrie deals 800% ATK of Adaptive DMG to attacking enemies when hit; CD: 5s. Triggering it again resets the duration. 2nd You Shall Punish Evil : Enemies struck by You Shall Know Your Sins two or more times take 40% more Total DMG. 5 SP is restored when these enemies are hit by You Shall Know Your Sins. 3rd Note Basic ATK is high priority to +3.

During Global Time Fracture caused by detonation, enemies take 30% more Total DMG in addition. 1st Saga: Overlapping Needles : Gravitational Field affects a larger area and gain a stronger pull. DMG-dealing hits deal and extra 500% ATK of Adaptive DMG. Filler Note I didn't actually intend to get Puppetry in this run. Completely ignore it, as we already get the needed Breach from Hua2 and Aponia2's Breach. Then, Drama is really high priority to +3. Either Pendulum or Conflict also good to +3, but give higher priority to Griseo2's signets. Griseo - Signet of Stars (4th Core) # Signet Priority Red & Hot : Using a weapon active taints enemies nearby with red paint for 8s and makes them take 25% bonus Physical and Elemental DMG (cannot stack).

Yellow is good to +3, even more if you get Grey afterwards. Black is nice to have at +2 from 3* Remembrance Sigil Abuse, which in turn is also strongly recommended for getting Petals and Fallen Leaves both at +2. Then, Black and Fallen Leaves are good to +3. Sakura - Signet of Setsuna (Felis Shop Signets) # Signet Priority Bountiful Blossom: Koyo : Triggering Ultimate Evasion Skill boosts Total DMG taken by all enemies by 30% for 8s. 1st Bountiful Blossom: Botan : Triggering Ultimate Evasion Skill boosts Total DMG by 40% for 8s. 2nd Bountiful Blossom: Fuji : Ultimate Evasion Skill has 1 more charge and 10% reduced CD. Optional 3rd -- Knight Form Build # Note Updated to 6.3. Okay, so, for gameplay purposes. There are a few things to be noted that need to be clear. Unlike Guardian Form, this build has a rather annoying and glaring weakness. It's very dependant on gather. Since this build is focused on single-target damage due to the nature of how PE's Charged ATK works, you need gather. And then, make sure your Charged ATK is hitting ALL gathered enemies. While it's possible for PE to reposition herself during the Charge so that she can control the direction where the Charge will go, this is very important to micromanage in order to actually make sure you're not wasting your DPS potential. This is important especially for Double Bonus floors if you want to make sure you'll get them. Boss to be chosen: Husk Mysticism, then Aponia or Vill-V. Setup # Rank Difficulty Done Recommended Gear Clear Time Run SSS Finality Midnight Ataegina & BiankaT 6:37m (6.3) https://youtu.be/Hce6RuBsk_Y Note In downscalability terms, while PE can use stigs like Elysia TB and Dirac M, you can expect her performance to probably not be as comparable as full BiankaT, but nonetheless she should work well. Other weapons, though... that's one sad PE. Buff Load Enemies hit by weapon active take 5% bonus total dmg for 5s 5 For every 60 hits, enemies take 3% more total dmg, capped at 15%. 10 Physical and Elemental dmg increases by 15% for 4s after triggering Ultimate evasion 10 Time slowed enemies take 8% bonus total dmg for 4s 5 Note Updated for 6.4. Whichever of the 10 doesn't matter; both can have the same consistency, but you can go with the Time-Slowed one if you don't have confidence in avoiding being hit. Time Remembrance Sigil FC Support Skill Early Memory Hometown Mid Forget-Me-Not / Veil of Tears / Rainbow of Absence The Lonely Moon OR Falling in Past Light Late Key to the Deep Falling in Past Light Note Hometown is essential to get Hua's 3 signets at +3 right away. By F6 Shop, you can swap it to The Lonely Moon, then later you can swap TLM for Falling in Past Light before Heimdall fight. Time Support 1 Support 2 Early SN SS Mid BK SS Late BR SS Note SN and SS are your staple supports during almost all the run. SN not only provides an useful gather on a 30s CD but also 15% TDM. BR is not recommended due to making use of the 1 Sp/s Load. SA can be used instead, but in exchange for 50s CD. For Heimdall, make sure to bring BK. Then, for Husk Mysticism fight, you can swap SN out for BR. Elysia - Signet of \u25a0\u25a0 # Signet Priority Blessing of Gallop : The physical DMG of Valkyrie is increased by 15%, and the physical DMG of Elite Thrust is increased by 0.4% for every 1% of HP lost.

Ultimate is also very good to +3. When you have Basic, use Active until Aponia2 hits, then go into Knight Form. When you also get Ultimate afterwards, you can just Active (only if you already have Griseo's Red Paint) then go into Knight Form straight away. Kalpas - Signet of Decimation (3rd Core) # Signet Priority Blade, Grave and Scar : Every 100 HP loss boosts Total DMG by 1.0%. 1st Bone, Blood and Ribbon : Every 100 HP loss boosts Physical & Elemental DMG by 0.8%. 2nd Path, Misfortune and Written Fate : Max HP increases by 25%. 3rd Desireless, Mindless and Homeless : Losing HP boosts Total DMG taken by all enemies by 25% for 8s. 4th Nexus Signet 2: Soldiers, Scissors, Spoils, and Slaughter Note All 4 of Kalpas' signets are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to get with 3* Remembrance Sigil Abuse. Getting them this way will be a really massive powerspike for PE.

Buff Load Taking more than 300 Elemental dmg from the currrent valkyrie makes enemies take 20% more total dmg for 10 seconds. 15 Enemies hit by weapon active take 5% bonus total dmg for 5s 5 For every 60 hits, enemies take 3% more total dmg, capped at 15%. 10 Note Updated for 6.4. Time Remembrance Sigil FC Support Skill Early Veil of Tears OR Pseudo Miracle The Lonely Moon OR Falling in Past Light Mid Mad King's Mask / Forbidden Seed / Rainbow of Absence Because of You OR Falling in Past Light Late Tin Flask or Key to the Deep Falling in Past Light Note Because Of You is best taken by F5 shop: as early as possible, and it's only if you want to secure getting Midnight (see Ego signet section for more info). The Lonely Moon or Falling in Past Light as start depends on your preference; FPL preferred if you want to take the V-V start route, TLM for Aponia start route. Time Support 1 Support 2 Early AE BR Mid AE BR or BK Late AE BR Note You'll want to prioritize saving AE for gather sometimes if you are lacking in a ELF that has gather or while you don't have Vill-V's 2nd Core unlocked, as Fischl is straight up horrible without it. She's literally dependant on it due to her almost non-existent AoE damage, especially when lacking 3rd signet which is pretty much a requirement. Note BKE is only for the purposes of filling Heimdall's Heavy Trauma Bar, forcefully ending his Red Mode. Elysia - Signet of \u25a0\u25a0 # Signet Priority Blessing of Retribution : Grants 1 stack of Blessing of Retribution every 7s. 2 stacks max. QTE consumes 1 stack to create a small lightning field which lasts 2s and deals 3x225% ATK of Lightning DMG per 0.4s to enemies within.

Every 7 hits from Oz on enemies within the Ultimate range summons dark lightning to deal 1500% ATK of Lightning DMG 2nd Blessing of Nightfall : Weapon actives deal 200% bonus Total DMG. Summoning Oz with Charged ATK or casting Ultimate refills 2 weapon active charges No Blessing of Dark Wings : When Ultimate Evasion Skill is triggered, Oz unleashes dark lightning to deal 4200% ATK of Lightning DMG No Note Fischl requires 3 Ego signets: Retribution into Fate start, then Midnight. 3rd Ego signet is a MUST because Fischl's personal and AoE damage is genuinely horrible without Midnight. It forms such a big part of her build here in ER that Fischl without any of these 3 signets becomes one of the weakest and most dogshit ER valks in the game. As such, Because of You is recommended to secure this. Danger This build has 2 different startups to note: We're gonna assume V-V start. Aponia start is slightly stronger, but V-V start is more comfortable and preferred if you don't have any ELF that provides gather or don't want to bother too much resetting for spawn RNG and maintaining enemies in the circle for Retribution. That's the only importance of choice; whether you choose one or the other, their order of priority is just swapped up between them. (Aponia 1st, V-V 2nd) Vill-V - Signet of Helix (1st Core) # Note Ideal course of build up: 2/3 Ego Start, finish V-V 2nd Core by F4 or F6, shop at F5, then either finish Aponia 2nd Core by F7 or grab V-V2's both Drama and Puppetry.

During Global Time Fracture, gain 30% Physical and Elemental Breach. 1st Drama: Origin of Slumber : During Gravitational Field, enemies take 20% more Total DMG. During Global Time Fracture caused by detonation, enemies take 30% more Total DMG in addition. 2nd Aponia - Signet of Discipline (2nd Core) # Signet Priority Sixth, No Decadence : Boosts Valkyrie Total DMG by 20% and keeps Exhortation from reducing for 15s upon QTE hitting an enemy. Triggering it again resets the duration. 1st Fourth, No Insolence : Exhortation increases by 5 per second and caps at 200. Ultimate's Physical and Elemental DMG increases by 0.3% of of Exhortation.

Triggering it again resets the duration. 1st You Shall Punish Evil : Enemies struck by You Shall Know Your Sins two or more times take 40% more Total DMG. 5 SP is restored when these enemies are hit by You Shall Know Your Sins. 2nd You Shall Answer Prayers : Triggering You Shall Know Your Sins causes the Valkyrie to enter Penance for 8s. In Penance, the Valkyrie takes 30% less Total DMG and deals 40% more Physical and Elemental DMG to enemies. Valkyrie deals 800% ATK of Adaptive DMG to attacking enemies when hit; CD: 5s. Triggering it again resets the duration. 3rd Kalpas - Signet of Decimation (3rd Core) # Signet Priority Blade, Grave and Scar : Every 100 HP loss boosts Total DMG by 1.0%. 1st Bone, Blood and Ribbon : Every 100 HP loss boosts Physical & Elemental DMG by 0.8%. 2nd Path, Misfortune and Written Fate : Max HP increases by 25%. 3rd Nexus Signet 2: Soldiers, Scissors, Spoils, and Slaughter Not Necessary Note Fischl has no in-built healing, and due to the usage of BR, she doesn't need Kalpas cores. Instead, only aim for Kalpas' both DMG boosts and Max HP. Preferred to take from Felis Shop basically. Mobius - Signet of Infinity (4th Core) # Signet Priority Entwined [P] : For every summoned entity, ELF, or Support Valkyrie present, enemies take 8% bonus Total DMG (5 stacks max). 1st Rodent [V] : For every summoned entity, ELF, or Support Valkyrie present, Valkyrie deals 10% bonus Total DMG (5 stacks max). 2nd Lip Poison [E] : Total DMG from summoned entities, ELFs, and Support Valkyries increases by 60%. 3rd Lodging [C] : ELF Ultimates and Support Valkyries' support skills have 20% reduced CD.

Reset on exiting Mind Sync. 1st, YES Newborn [X] : Triggering Mind Sync again during Mind Sync no longer resets the duration but extends the duration by 4.0s instead. With any summoned entity present, the duration is extended by 5s additionally. 2nd, YES Note Mobius is REALLY high priority to finish and get both Dead [X] and Newborn [X]. The reason is because of the way Oz works. Oz stays in field way too long, and Fischl's only means of recasting Oz to naturally refresh Mind Sync's duration is through the signet of Nightfall or through Ultimate Cast. This makes Newborn [X] as VERY essential and must-take alongside Dead [X]. Basically, Dead [X] won't be useful for long without Newborn [X] present. Griseo - Signet of Stars (5th Core) # Signet Priority Red & Hot : Using a weapon active taints enemies nearby with red paint for 8s and makes them take 25% bonus Physical and Elemental DMG (cannot stack).

Optional 1st Note You can try to gamble for getting Withered Soil, mainly due to 6S's noticeably big SP Regen during her Combos. Griseo - Signet of Stars (3rd Core) # Signet Priority Red & Hot : Using a weapon active taints enemies nearby with red paint for 8s and makes them take 25% bonus Physical and Elemental DMG (cannot stack).

This also allows 6S to instantly go into Combo ATK which is even more recommended if your weapon is not Rhapsody. Spina Astera # Quick search: SpA, Rita, Fire Rita -- Rita's Training Arc 7D # Note Updated 6.4. SpA had enough of sitting in the bench just warming it while watching other valkyries push ahead of her, so she decided to finally take matters into her hands and train to become a better valkyrie and catch up to the others! And she sure did went a bit overboard... by becoming even stronger than before! SpA's strength in favorable weathers is pretty strong and she also becomes a fairly easy valk to clear ER with. Although she struggles even more against Psy mobs. Boss to be chosen: Husk Mysticism, then Aponia or Vill-V Note You should consider Hephaestus' Overheat mechanic. You might not be able to kill him. If you're not confident in doing so, you can instead go with Husk, but he's more annoying due to SpA's lack of i-frames which makes her be reliant on manual dodging even more, as she already uses Kosma.

Once you get Radiant Formation, doing any normal Rapier stabs will reduce the Ultimate's CD by 20%, allowing you to play around it for quick bursts. The other 2 Ego signets to get are Alrescha and Holy Flame. Star Quillon is really unnecessary, but you can take it if you don't get any better doors. Aponia - Signet of Discipline (1st Core) # Note Ideal course of build up: 2 Ego start (Wild Flare + Radiant Formation) into Aponia's Basic ATK F3, finish Aponia 2nd Core by F4 Double, go shop F5 and put Because of You, buy Griseo's Red and Yellow paints or Red and Eden's TDM, grab Aponia's Breach at F6 and get the remaining 2 Enhanceds from Aponia at F7 Double Signet Priority First, No Betrayal : Exhortation increases by 5 per second and caps at 200.

As long as you have at least Red, you can focus on the other signets in the meanwhile and leave Griseo by last. Red is highest priority to upgrade to +3. -- Kosma Build 7D # Note Updated 6.4. This valk is fucking awful. Honest truth. Her early game absolutely sucks, even as SS-rank, and loses against valks like Fischl and Eden in that regard. She only starts ramping up in strength after Benares, but even then, she still sucks a bit as she becomes mediocre at best. If anything, I would honestly recommend to play other valks instead of this shitty valk. She just really sucks, nothing more. Boss to be chosen: Husk Mysticism, then Elysia, Aponia or Vill-V. Setup # Rank Difficulty Done Recommended Gear Clear Time Run SS Finality Pisces & Ragna 10:16m (6.0 1st Half) https://youtu.be/IDZt4TyONVo Note In terms of downscalability purposes, SpA is kinda bad, suffering mostly from a really shitty early game and a sort of mediocre mid-game.

When you add Aponia into the mix, then her \"downtime\" outside Rapier Stabs is fixed, and as such, Kosma is an essential part of her kit here.

Relying on the generation of Carmine Gashes to recover SP for herself and get ready to ult everytime, she actually has a quite comfortable downtime. However, this is locked behind the requirement of needing one of her Ego signets. For a full explanation, you can read the video run's description. Boss to be chosen: RPC, then Vill-V or Aponia Note Nyx might struggle finishing Aponia off before she goes flying in her P2. If u want faster clear time, V-V is the choice.

Not only her own signature weapon helps her a lot, but also other stigmata choices lose out on more than 20% DPS comparison to Verne. Simply speaking, for downscalability purposes, expect this valk to be more affected the worse the gears are.

This basically means, that although Griseo is still good with F2P signets (Elysia TB), the worse the stigs are, the worse she'll perform. This can be overcome to some extent by a maxed Elysian Astra.

Good luck maintaining your sanity against Mysticism. Seriously. Setup # Rank Difficulty Done Recommended Gear Clear Time Run SSS Finality Hekate Sombre & Kafka 11:25m (6.3) https://youtu.be/xmXJjr7kx4Q Note This valkyrie's downscalability issues can be notoriously bad as she also sort of relies in her signature weapon for the endless combo hits, especially at early game when you don't have much room for continuously reducing your Ult's CD.

You know, Bear sure is quite a strong B-Rank Valkyrie alright... Wait, wasn't she supposed to be just B-Rank!? How come she's so strong in ER too!? VQ's early game is actually a bit weak, her real strength starts to show right after finishing her first core and by mid floors. Then, she scales rather hard towards the late floors. If you're wondering about how the strength of VQ's Ult build compares to her other possible build, the Combo one, the answer is that at SS rank, they're both at equal strength; with Ultimate winning slightly. However, at SSS rank, Combo wins by a very drastically large margin leaving Ult build behind. Ult build, however, is very braindead and rather comfy. It also is really strong against Heimdall by virtue of Susannah having complete i-frames during her Ultimate, whereas Combo build has tight i-frames that require Susannah to evade in-between in order to not lose Hua stacks (or if without it, she dies easily) against Heimdall's attacks in red mode. Other than that, Susannah's gameplay is really simple too. Here it's just have some means of gather (if you don't have a gather ELF, I recommend you to bring SN over BR; however, if you're lacking damage, keep BR), then use Active into Combo (make sure Active hits to fully recharge bar), then farm enough SP for Ultimate and use it, then repeat the whole sequence until enemies die. Boss to be Chosen: Couatl, then Elysia (fastest), Vill-V or Aponia.

TLM helps A LOT in this build as long as you time it right for the waves and against Couatl. Time Support 1 Support 2 Early SS LE Mid SS BR / BK Late SS SN Note You never swap SS out. LE is mandatory for Early game to help with spamming Ult. Then swap LE out for BR at F6 Shop for the remainder of the run. For Heimdall, you can choose to bring BK if you're not confident in dealing with him since VQ doesn't have any way to break his shields. For Couatl, bring SN.

Vermilion Knight: Eclipse # Quick search: VK, VKE, Himedead -- Ultimate Spam Build # Note Updated 6.4. Alright. This is by far the best result I've gotten out of VK's Ultimate Build. This is a good showcase of how absurdly strong her power is during this shilled weather, placing her easily as basically a cheatcode to clear ER with in the current patch. Boss to be chosen: Husk Mysticism, then Vill-V or Elysia (to booli her) Setup # Rank Difficulty Done Recommended Gear Clear Time Run S3 Finality Shuhadaku of Uriel & Aslaug TB Himeko M 4:41m (6.2 1st Half) https://youtu.be/Oq-EE1zbGNQ S3 Finality Blood Dance & Leuweenhoek TB Himeko M 7:58m (6.2 1st Half) https://youtu.be/VaQ6j6fEaGk Note For Ultimate Build, Aslaug TB and Himeko M is her BiS. As alternatives, Leuweenhoek TB Thales M can be used. Uriel is also a given for this build, being its BiS. Other than that, VK's downscalability is really good, since she has a lot of good Stigma alternatives, with LWH TB Thales M being her best F2P craftable stigs. She also doesn't lose in weapon options, with Blood Dance being her BiS F2P weapon (obtainable from Exchange Shop). Buff Load Taking more than 300 Elemental dmg from the currrent valkyrie makes enemies take 20% more total dmg for 10 seconds. 15 Enemies hit by weapon active take 5% bonus total dmg for 5s 5 For every 60 hits, enemies take 3% more total dmg, capped at 15%. 10 Note Updated for 6.4. Time Remembrance Sigil FC Support Skill Early Mad King's Mask An Old Pal's Legacy OR The Lonely Moon Mid Veil of Tears / Burden / Rainbow of Absence / Feast of Emptiness The Lonely Moon Late Key to the Deep or Tin Flask The Lonely Moon Note An Old Pal's Legacy is variably the best start in order to start with +3 Kalpas signets straight away. However, do note that if your VK is missing Uriel, she might not be strong enough to clear 4F double without the assistance of The Lonely Moon, in which case, you take The Lonely Moon instead. Time Support 1 Support 2 Early AE LE Mid AE BR / LE Late AE BR / LE Note LE is essential for the early game. Once you reach F5 Shop, and assuming you get Burning Flow as your 2nd Ego signet, then you can ditch LE out for BR for the remainder of the run. Elysia - Signet of \u25a0\u25a0 # Signet Priority Blessing of Fiery Mind : Each hit of Ultimate deals an extra 600% ATK of Fire DMG. Casting Ultimate costs 10% HP, but if HP is below 18%, it is restored to 18%.

No Blessing of Sharp Flames : Charged ATK's Schielhau deals an extra 600 + 800% ATK of Fire DMG. Charged ATK SEQ 1 pulls surrounding enemies, CD: 3s. No Note It's important to note here that the 2nd Ego signet that you'll choose depends on whether or not you have Uriel or An Utu. With Uriel, your VK should be strong enough to have so much damage overflow that simply getting Wild Flare will be enough for the entirety of the remainder of the run. However, if you either don't have it, or you want the comfortable option, you can just take Burning Flow and later on if you do get a 3rd Ego door, take Wild Flare. Additionally, if your pick is Wild Flare, then Burning Flow becomes a good 3rd Ego signet to take if you get a 3rd Ego door later in your run. Note Additionally, if your pick is Wild Flare, then Burning Flow becomes a good 3rd Ego signet to take if you get a 3rd Ego door later in your run.

If you have coins to spend otherwise, then go 2nd Core. -- Charged ATK Spam Build # Note Updated 6.4. Not enjoying the Ultimate build perhaps, are we? Maybe because of its reliance on gather in order to unga bunga your way through every floor's waves and waves of mobs coming up to try and stop you? Or.. maybe you just want to have some fun with Charged Build together with its... ahem... quite horrible and uncomfortable at times, gather signet and Charged ATKs on steroids?

If you get a 3rd Ego door, it's strongly recommended to take it for Wild Flare because it activates with Chargeds as well, and it also synergizes very well with Uriel.

The reason is because, if successful, it further increases your chances at being able to clear your run successfully, and can even shorten your clear time by improving it in a noticeable way compared to how it would go in a normal run without making use of this trick. So, what's it about? Basically, you replace both your General and Support Remembrance Sigils for the 3 Star ones of the desired FC's signets of choice. As an example, here's Griseo's 3 Star Remembrance Sigil together with her own Support Skill. This is an intended design. Every one of the FC's 3* Star Remembrance Sigils aside from their own Support Skills give an additional +1 starting level to the signets picked or shown at Felis Shop (Only when you reroll at the moment of having them equipped) as shown in their descriptions. It's very simple, but the core of it basically relies on having good luck with the RNG at the moment of rerolling for signets at Felis Shop. It's still, however, a very strongly recommended gamble to do in every one of your runs WITH the exception of when your money is running low or when the cost for rerolling the Shop signets is already at 160 at which point you drop it off. With both 3* Star Remembrance Sigils, you can get the desired FC signets starting at +2 once they appear in Felis Shop from a reroll. This also works with Doors, and it's especially recommended to gamble for this for the Double Floors, even more so if you've already unlocked that FC's Core and it has at least 2 Enhanceds that are priority to get and very desirable to get at increased upgrade levels. Another good reason is that, by design, even when in the current weather the FC's signets get a +2 level on choosing them, this only applies to the Basic Signets, not the Enhanceds. Additionally, Herrscher of Humanity can also further abuse this. Since she already passively gets +1 starting level to every FC signet picked, having both 3* Remembrance Sigils of a FC will make that FC's signets to start at the max +3 level instead of the normal +2. HoH's cheat doesn't apply to Enhanceds however. Creditors and what they did: # (Retired) Adori - Columbina Supremacy#6481: Tester, theorycrafter and current big updater of builds from 5.9 onwards+.

And she sure did went a bit overboard... by becoming even stronger than before! SpA's strength in favorable weathers is pretty strong and she also becomes a fairly easy valk to clear ER with. Although she struggles even more against Psy mobs. Boss to be chosen: Husk Mysticism, then Aponia or Vill-V Note You should consider Hephaestus' Overheat mechanic. You might not be able to kill him. If you're not confident in doing so, you can instead go with Husk, but he's more annoying due to SpA's lack of i-frames which makes her be reliant on manual dodging even more, as she already uses Kosma.","title":"-- Rita's Training Arc 7D"},{"location":"#-kosma-build-7d","text":"Note Updated 6.4.

If anything, I would honestly recommend to play other valks instead of this shitty valk. She just really sucks, nothing more.

You know, Bear sure is quite a strong B-Rank Valkyrie alright... Wait, wasn't she supposed to be just B-Rank!? How come she's so strong in ER too!? VQ's early game is actually a bit weak, her real strength starts to show right after finishing her first core and by mid floors. Then, she scales rather hard towards the late floors. If you're wondering about how the strength of VQ's Ult build compares to her other possible build, the Combo one, the answer is that at SS rank, they're both at equal strength; with Ultimate winning slightly. However, at SSS rank, Combo wins by a very drastically large margin leaving Ult build behind. Ult build, however, is very braindead and rather comfy. It also is really strong against Heimdall by virtue of Susannah having complete i-frames during her Ultimate, whereas Combo build has tight i-frames that require Susannah to evade in-between in order to not lose Hua stacks (or if without it, she dies easily) against Heimdall's attacks in red mode. Other than that, Susannah's gameplay is really simple too. Here it's just have some means of gather (if you don't have a gather ELF, I recommend you to bring SN over BR; however, if you're lacking damage, keep BR), then use Active into Combo (make sure Active hits to fully recharge bar), then farm enough SP for Ultimate and use it, then repeat the whole sequence until enemies die.

The reason is because, if successful, it further increases your chances at being able to clear your run successfully, and can even shorten your clear time by improving it in a noticeable way compared to how it would go in a normal run without making use of this trick. So, what's it about? Basically, you replace both your General and Support Remembrance Sigils for the 3 Star ones of the desired FC's signets of choice. As an example, here's Griseo's 3 Star Remembrance Sigil together with her own Support Skill. This is an intended design. Every one of the FC's 3* Star Remembrance Sigils aside from their own Support Skills give an additional +1 starting level to the signets picked or shown at Felis Shop (Only when you reroll at the moment of having them equipped) as shown in their descriptions. It's very simple, but the core of it basically relies on having good luck with the RNG at the moment of rerolling for signets at Felis Shop. It's still, however, a very strongly recommended gamble to do in every one of your runs WITH the exception of when your money is running low or when the cost for rerolling the Shop signets is already at 160 at which point you drop it off. With both 3* Star Remembrance Sigils, you can get the desired FC signets starting at +2 once they appear in Felis Shop from a reroll. This also works with Doors, and it's especially recommended to gamble for this for the Double Floors, even more so if you've already unlocked that FC's Core and it has at least 2 Enhanceds that are priority to get and very desirable to get at increased upgrade levels. Another good reason is that, by design, even when in the current weather the FC's signets get a +2 level on choosing them, this only applies to the Basic Signets, not the Enhanceds. Additionally, Herrscher of Humanity can also further abuse this. Since she already passively gets +1 starting level to every FC signet picked, having both 3* Remembrance Sigils of a FC will make that FC's signets to start at the max +3 level instead of the normal +2. HoH's cheat doesn't apply to Enhanceds however.","title":"-- 3* Remembrance Sigil Abuse \"Cheatcode\":"},{"location":"#creditors-and-what-they-did","text":"(Retired) Adori - Columbina Supremacy#6481: Tester, theorycrafter and current big updater of builds from 5.9 onwards+.
